      <h3>Investigation</h3>
      <p>reSet and reSet-o by Pear Therapeutics are FDA approved apps aimed at increasing abstinence in substance/opiod and supplementing a patientâ€™s typical in-person therapy. The apps use congitive behavioral therapy and studies have shown that using reSet-O increases buprenorphine adherence which is associated with a lower cost of healthcare resources. As long as patients are willing to pay $6,000 or more.</p>

      <h3 class="my-2">Most Effective Method</h3>
      <p>The most effective way to prevent homelessness seems to be providing mental health services to people with low incomes and/or housing insecurity. Many researchers have proved an association between homelessness and mental health issues which means these services should decrease the financial strain mental illnessess put on people and prevent them from negatively affecting their lives. </p>
      <h3 class="my-2">Use of Technology</h3>
      <p>Apps that help with mental illness and life skills can be a more convinient way to receive these services. An app can be effective because it doesn't require people to go out of their way to get help and takes significantly less time. Technology can also be used to spread awareness about the services that are available to people so they know to take advantage of the benefits they have access to.</p>
      <h3 class="my-2">Implications</h3>
      <p>An app that can provide cognitive behavioral therapy to those struggling with mental health that is also readily available to people with low incomes could help people avoid falling into downward spirals. The app could also help to improve life skills so people can better address their struggles and have the ability to regain their footing should they falter.</p>
