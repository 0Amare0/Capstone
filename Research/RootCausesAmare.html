        <h1>Claim Statement #1</h1>
        <p>Homelessness is often the result of people’s failure to endure debilitating personal hardships such as physical health issues, grief, abuse, or mental illness because these conditions cause them to falter in life. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col border border-4 p-4 mx-3">
        <h1>Claim Statement #2</h1>
        <p>Another cause is a “service deficiency,” a failure to deliver a service to a person entitled to it, in the structure of systems in place to help people in need, which causes them to have to deal with life’s struggles without assistance. </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="row text-white p-2 mx-1">
      <div class=" p-4 mx-3"></div>
        <div class="col border border-4 p-4 mx-1">
          <h2>Evidence</h2>
          <p>The odds ratio of homelessness between having adverse childhood experiences and not was 13 for lack of parental care, 16 for physical abuse, 1.7 for sexual abuse, and 26 for lack of care or either type of abuse. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-4 p-4 mx-1">
          <h2>Evidence</h2>
          <p>The odds ratio of men having experienced any drug between those who have never been homeless and those who have was 1.18 and the odds ratio for women was 1.94</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col border border-4 p-4 mx-1">
          <h2>Evidence</h2>
          <p>1/3 of older people in England don’t claim social security benefits they’re entitled to and 1/10 don’t claim housing subsidies. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-4 p-4 mx-1">
          <h2>Evidence</h2>
          <p>The Victorian public housing wait list increased from 41,000 in 2000 to 44,500 in 2001. </p>

        <div class="col border border-4 p-4 mx-1">
          <h2>Reasoning</h2>
          <p>The likelihood of homeless people who have been dependent on any drugs compared to those who haven’t suggests a correlation. The likelihood of those with adverse childhood experiences becoming homeless compared to those who haven’t also suggests a correlation and a possible causation between these hardships and becoming homeless.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-4 p-4 mx-1">
          <h2>Implications</h2>
          <p>If having suffered from adverse childhood experiences or another form of personal hardship can lead to homelessness, a service to help people cope with thier experiences could prevent them from becoming homeless. A way to aid people suffering from addiction, grief, or trauma to improve their living situation would be a good solution. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-4 p-4 mx-1">
          <h2>Reasoning</h2>
            <p>The fact that so many older people in England don’t claim social security benefits such as housing subsidies means that the government hasn’t done a good enough job at making these resources known. The vast growth in Victoria’s public housing wait list also shows the inadequacy of government services meant to help people in need. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col border border-4 p-4 mx-1">
            <h2>Implications</h2>
            <p>A way to let more people know about the services that can help them with their living situation or decomplicate the processes relating to these services would be very useful. A bigger focus and/or budget in the government for making public housing services more accessible would benefit those faltering in life. </p>
